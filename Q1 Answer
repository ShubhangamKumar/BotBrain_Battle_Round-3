In today's world, manual searches for lost or required items can be time-consuming and inefficient. Technological advancements have made it possible to automate these tasks using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) such as autonomous drones. These UAVs can autonomously take flight, navigate outdoor environments, and land without human intervention.

The goal is to develop a fleet of UAVs that can efficiently search for and identify specific targets among various objects scattered over grassy terrains. These drones will not only identify targets but also communicate their locations to other drones in the fleet using swarm technology. This capability can be particularly useful in military applications, such as locating enemies who have illegally crossed national borders by detecting predefined specifications like uniform characteristics.

By leveraging autonomous UAVs, we can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of search operations across various fields, including national defense, without direct human involvement.
