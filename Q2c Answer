   b.Justification: Increased flight time is crucial for extended missions and reduces the frequency of recharging or swapping batteries, thereby improving operational efficiency.
   c.Reference: Research indicates that solid-state batteries offer higher energy densities and improved safety over conventional LiPo batteries (Wang, Y. et al., 2020, "Solid-state batteries: Materials, designs, and challenges," Journal of Energy Chemistry).

2. Improved Propulsion System 
   a.Change: Use brushless DC motors with higher efficiency and redesigned propellers for optimized thrust and reduced noise.
   b.Justification: Enhancing the propulsion system can lead to better performance, increased flight stability, and quieter operation, which is beneficial for surveillance and commercial applications.
   c.Reference: A study on the optimization of drone propulsion systems shows significant improvements in flight efficiency and noise reduction with advanced motor and propeller designs (Mellinger, D. et al., 2013, "Design and control of quadrotors with application to autonomous flying," Springer Tracts in Advanced Robotics).

3. Advanced Obstacle Avoidance System
   a.Change: Incorporate a more sophisticated obstacle detection and avoidance system using a combination of LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and AI-based image recognition.
   b.Justification: This improves the drone's ability to navigate complex environments autonomously, reducing the risk of collisions and enhancing mission reliability.
   c.Reference: The integration of AI and multi-sensor fusion for obstacle avoidance has shown promising results in enhancing the autonomous navigation capabilities of UAVs (Kuwata, Y. et al., 2014, "Safe and robust multi-UAV motion planning with temporal logic constraints," IEEE Transactions on Robotics).

4. Lightweight and Durable Materials
   a.Change: Use advanced composite materials like carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) for the drone frame.
   b.Justification: These materials provide a high strength-to-weight ratio, making the drone lighter and more durable, which contributes to longer flight times and improved resilience in harsh conditions.
   c.Reference: The application of CFRP in UAVs has demonstrated significant improvements in both structural integrity and weight reduction (Suresh, K. et al., 2018, "Composite Materials for Aerospace Applications," Defence Science Journal).

5. Modular Design
   a.Change: Implement a modular design allowing for easy swapping of components such as cameras, sensors, and payloads.
   b.Justification: A modular design enhances the versatility of the drone, enabling it to be quickly adapted for different missions without extensive downtime or specialized tools.
   c.Reference: Modular designs in UAVs have been found to significantly improve operational flexibility and maintenance efficiency (Zufferey, J.-C. et al., 2019, "Aerial Modular Robots," IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters).

6. Enhanced Communication Systems
   a.Change: Upgrade to a dual-band communication system (2.4GHz and 5GHz) with extended range and better interference resistance.
   b.Justification: Reliable and robust communication is essential for real-time control and data transmission, especially in challenging environments with potential interference.
   c.Reference: Studies show that dual-band communication systems offer improved reliability and range, making them suitable for various UAV applications (Niu, Y. et al., 2015, "A survey of millimeter wave (mmWave) communications for 5G: Opportunities and challenges," Wireless Networks).

Conclusion
