Autonomous Drone Search and Target Identification System
System Overview
The system consists of three autonomous drones designed to search for a specific target within a designated area. Each drone is equipped with a LIDAR sensor for object detection and measurement, and a color sensor for target identification. The drones communicate with each other using swarm technology to coordinate their actions and ensure efficient and collision-free operation.

1.Functionality and Operation
  i.Initialization and Takeoff
    a.Drones power on and perform self-checks.
    b.Autonomous takeoff to a predetermined altitude.

  ii.Search Pattern and Navigation
     a.Each drone follows a unique, pre-programmed search pattern to cover the entire search area without overlap.
     b.Drones continuously scan for objects using their LIDAR sensors.

  iii.Object Detection and Measurement
      a.When a drone detects an object with a height of 15cm, it pauses to measure the other two dimensions (width and length). 
      b.The drone uses the LIDAR sensor to verify if the dimensions are 15cm x 15cm x 15cm.

  iv.Color Detection
     a.If the dimensions match, the drone uses its color sensor to check the object's color.
     b.The target color is predefined as green.

   v.Target Identification and Communication
     a.If the object is green, the drone identifies it as the target.
     b.The drone immediately sends the target's location and identification information to the other two drones using swarm technology.
     c.Upon receiving the target information, the other drones stop their search and return to a standby or home position.

   vi.Autonomous Landing
      a.All drones perform an autonomous landing sequence after the target is identified and communicated.

  ii.Search and Detection
     a.Execute Search Pattern
     b.LIDAR Scan for Object Height
     c.If Object Height is 15cm: 
         Measure Object Dimensions
         If Dimensions are 15cm x 15cm x 15cm:
            Use Color Sensor to Detect Color
            If Color is Green:
               Identify Target
               Communicate Target Information to Other Drones
               Other Drones Stop Search 
            Else:
               Continue Search Pattern
            Else:
               Continue Search Pattern

3.Detailed Workflow
  i.Initialization and Takeoff
    a.Step 1: The drones are powered on, and system checks are performed to ensure all sensors and communication modules are functioning correctly.
    b.Step 2: Each drone takes off autonomously to a predetermined altitude where it begins its search pattern.

  ii.Search Pattern and Navigation
     a.Step 3: Drones navigate according to their pre-programmed search patterns, which are designed to cover the entire search area without overlap.
     b.Step 4: Drones continuously scan the ground for objects using their LIDAR sensors.

  iii.Object Detection and Measurement
      a.Step 5: Upon detecting an object with a height of 15cm, the drone pauses its flight and uses the LIDAR sensor to measure the width and length of the object.
      b.Step 6: If the object's dimensions are confirmed to be 15cm x 15cm x 15cm, the drone proceeds to the next step.

  iv.Color Detection
     a.Step 7: The drone uses its color sensor to analyze the color of the object.
     b.Step 8: If the color is green, the object is identified as the target. If not, the drone resumes its search pattern.

  v.Target Identification and Communication
    a.Step 9: When the target is identified, the drone sends the location and identification information to the other two drones using swarm communication protocols.
    b.Step 10: The other drones, upon receiving the target information, stop their search and navigate to a standby or home position.

   vi.Autonomous Landing
      a.Step 11: After successfully identifying and communicating the target, all drones perform an autonomous landing sequence, completing the mission.

4.System Benefits and Applications
  i.Efficiency: The autonomous operation and coordinated search patterns ensure thorough coverage of the search area in minimal time.
  ii.Reliability: Swarm communication and collision prevention mechanisms enhance the system's reliability.
  iii.Versatility: The system can be adapted for various applications, including search and rescue, surveillance, and environmental monitoring.

By implementing this autonomous drone system with LIDAR and color sensors, efficient and accurate target detection in complex environments can be achieved, significantly enhancing operational capabilities across various fields.
